## Usage

To get started with this Flask project template, follow the installation instructions in the [Getting Started](##getting-started) section below. Once your project is set up, you can run it locally using the provided development server. Here are some common tasks:

- **Running the Development Server**: Use `python app.py runserver` to start the Flask development server.
- **Accessing Your App**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/` to access the application.
- **Customization**: Tailor the template to your project's needs by modifying routes, views, and templates.

## Project Structure

This Flask project template follows a structured directory layout for easy navigation and organization:
  ```bash
  project_name/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── routes.py
  │   ├── models.py
  │   ├── templates/
  │   │   └── index.html
  │   └── static/
  │       ├── css/
  │       │   └── styles.css
  │       ├── js/
  │       │   └── scripts.js
  │       └── img/
  ├── config.py
  └── run.py

  ```

Here's a brief description of each component:

- **app/**: The main application script.
  - **__init__.py**: Initializes the Flask app and extensions.
  - **routes.py**: Defines the app's URL routes and view functions.
  - **models.py**: Houses the data models or database schema.
  - **templates/**: Contains HTML templates for rendering web pages.
  - **static/**: Stores static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

- **config.py**: Configuration settings for your Flask app.

- **run.py**: A script to run your Flask application.

This organized structure makes it easy to locate and manage different components of your Flask project.
